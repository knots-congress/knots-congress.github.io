            description: "Fluid turbulence is a phenomenon characterised by the production of complex, large-scale tangles of vortex filaments that before final dissipation tend to decay to small-scale loops. A topological analysis of superfluid tangles shows that very complex knots and links are formed, and that upon mutual interaction and reconnection they gradually decompose to form small, unknotted, unlinked vortex rings [<a href='program#KKI16'>1</a>,<a href='program#CMBB19'>2</a>]. By using standard polynomials of knot theory derived from the fieldline helicity of vortex dynamics [<a href='program#RL23'>3</a>] we showed that our adapted polynomials can <i>quantify</i> the generic topological cascade observed in experiments [<a href='program#LRG24'>4</a>]. Here we present a topological approach to turbulence cascade based on the idea that the dynamical process could be viewed in terms of geodesic flows in an appropriate knot polynomial space (a discrete metric space), whose singletons represent knot types identified by their knot polynomial value [<a href='program#LRL20'>5</a>]. Optimal unlinking paths can thus be determined and put in relation with statistical measures of energy dissipation and information entropy. Work in this direction is in progress.<br/><br/>This is joint work with Xin Liu (Beijing University of Technology, P.R. China).<br/><br/><b>References</b><br/><br/><span id='KKI16'>[1] Kleckner, D., Kauffman, L.H.  &  Irvine, W.T.M.

          title: "Ribbon Surface-Link Overview",
          description: "An overview of ribbon surface-links that have been studied by the speaker to date will be presented. Ribbon surface-links are identified with chord graphs, and are a relaxed version of virtual graphs including virtual knotoids with groups identified with the fundamental groups. If a stabilization of a surface-link is a ribbon surface-link, then any handle-irreducible summand of the stabilized surface-link is a ribbon surface-link which is determined uniquely from the surface-link up to equivalences and stabilizations. Many results are obtained by using this result together with several other results. A surface-link with free fundamental group is a stabilization of a ribbon sphere-link, and a trivial surface-link if the fundamental group is  meridian-based. A connected sum of surface-links is a ribbon surface-link if and only if both the connected summands are ribbon surface-links. A surface-link of trivial components is a ribbon surface-link if the components are sphere-components except for at most one component. It will be also explained how this argument is related to 4D and 3D Poincare conjectures, J. H. C. Whitehead aspherical conjecture, Kervaire conjecture on group weight and the slice-ribbon problem as time allows.",

          description: "In 2023, the speaker formulated the photography method which allows one to solve various equations and construct invariants of various topological object. We start from some object (say, pentagon) and its state (say, triangulation) with some data (for example, edge lengths of  triangles) together with a transformation rule (say, a triangulation flip). After that, by using some geometrical consideration, one can \"automatically\" prove that such transformation lead to a solution of some equation (for example, the Ptolemy transormation givves a solution to the pentagon equation) which leads to invariants of various objects (for example, braids). After that, one can \"freely\" (without any calculations) get a formula coming from some geometrical data (say, lengths in the hyperbolic space). Having such a formula, one automatically gets its algebraic proof which allows one to pass from geometric objects (lengths, angles) to variables. This method is very vaste. In particular, Dijkgraaf-Witten invariants can be interpreted in terms of the photography method. We mention just some relations of further research: invariants of knots, braids, manifolds of arbitrary dimensions, solutions to the pentagon, Yang-Baxter and other equations, relations to cluster algebras, tropical geometry and other parts of mathematics.",

Bordered Floer homology is an invariant for low-dimensional manifolds, introduced in collaboration with Robert Lipshitz and Dylan Thurston. The bordered theory associates an algebra to a parameterized surface. To a three-manifold with boundary, it associates a module over the algebra of its boundary. To a closed three-manifold equipped with a separating surface, it expresses the Heegaard Floer homology as a tensor product of the modules associated to the two pieces. In fact, the original version of bordered Floer homology expresses the $U=0$ specialization of Heegaard Floer homology. I will outline work in progress with Robert Lipshitz and Dylan Thurston, addressing the algebraic and analytic challenges for generalizing the construction to the unspecialized setting.",

It is related to homotopy quantum field theory by V. Turaev. In this talk, I will recall the construction of these invariants, will  make a summary of a recent joint work with C. McPhail-Snyder and will explain why Poisson structures on the center of quantum groups at a root of unity that appear in this construction are natural from the geometry of flat connections in the complement to a tangle.",
