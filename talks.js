Recently, Akihiro Higashitani and Hirotake Kurihara established a characterization theorem for finite generalized Alexander quandles under certain assumptions and classified those with up to 15 elements. In this talk, we build upon their work by providing a broader characterization of generalized Alexander quandles, relaxing the assumptions of finiteness and other restrictive conditions. Furthermore, we classify these quandles with up to 127 elements. This is joint work with Akihiro Higashitani, Jin Kosaka, and Hirotake Kurihara.",

            title: "From Toroidal Pseudo Links to their Doubly Periodic Universal Covers",
            description: "A <i>doubly periodic (DP) tangle</i> is an embedding of curves in the thickened plane $\\mathbb{E}^2 \\times I$, that is invariant under translations in two independent directions. Formally, a DP tangle can be defined as the universal cover of a <i>toroidal link</i>, which is a link embedded in the thickened torus $T^2 \\times I$. Every toroidal link defined as the quotient of a DP tangle under a periodic lattice is called a <i>motif</i> of the DP tangle. DP tangles serve as a significant framework for analyzing and understanding the topological properties of interwoven filament systems across nano-, micro-, meso-, and macro-scales, including, but not limited to, molecular assemblies, polymer melts, fabric-like structures, and cosmic filaments.<br/><br/>In analogy to classical knot theory, the properties of DP tangles and their motifs can be studied using a two-dimensional diagrammatic approach. Considering cases where some over/under crossing information is unavailable, we extend the notion of <i>pseudo knots</i> introduced by Hanaki in <a href='program#Hanaki'>H</a>, to doubly periodic settings. This gives rise to the theory of <i>pseudo DP tangles</i>, where a <i>pseudo motif diagram</i> is a toroidal pseudo link diagram containing undetermined crossings, called <i>precrossings</i>.<br/><br/>In this talk, we first present the diagrammatic theory of <i>toroidal pseudo links</i>, which are equivalence classes of pseudo link diagrams in the torus under Reidemeister-type moves <a href='program#DLM1'>DLM1</a>. Defining then the <i>lifting</i> of a toroidal pseudo link diagram as a pseudo link diagram in $T^2 \\times I$, we translate this equivalence relation on the level of mixed links, where a <i>${\\rm H}$-mixed pseudo link</i> in $S^{3}$ is a pseudo link that contains a point-wise fixed Hopf link ${\\rm H}$ as a sublink. We also define topological invariants of toroidal pseudo links and ${\\rm H}$-mixed pseudo links, such as their <i>resolution sets</i>, which are sets of associated links obtained by assigning to each precrossing an over or under information, and their extended Kauffman bracket polynomials <a href='program#DLM2'>DLM2</a>.<br/></br>The second part of the talk focuses the theory of <i>doubly periodic pseudo tangles</i> (pseudo DP tangles) <a href='program#DLM3'>DLM3</a>, their equivalence classes, their resolution sets and their extended Kauffman bracket polynomials, generalizing works initiated by Grishanov et al. related to textiles <a href='program#Grishanov'>Grishanov</a>. We emphasize on the particular notions which make the equivalence of pseudo DP tangles differ from the equivalence of toroidal pseudo links, including the equivalence of pseudo motifs under <i>Dehn twists</i> and under <i>pseudo scale equivalence</i>.<br/><br/>A Dehn twist of a pseudo motif corresponds to a change of basis in the periodic lattice of the corresponding pseudo DP tangle, or equivalently to isotopies under a shearing transformation. The notion of scale equivalence, first introduced in <a href='program#Sonia'>Sonia</a>, defines an equivalence relation between different finite covers or quotients of a motif, which thus correspond to the same DP tangles, or equivalently to isotopies under stretching or contraction transformations preserving the periodicity while keeping the lattice fixed. In the specific case of pseudo DP tangles, we highlight an important subtlety to take into consideration in the pseudo scale equivalence. Since each precrossing of a pseudo motif diagram encodes a missing over/under information, this crossing information will be inherited by every corresponding precrossing, called <i>homologous precrossings</i>, generated by a finite cover of this diagram or its universal cover. These two notions are essential to take into consideration to define topological invariants for the classification of pseudo DP tangles.<br/><br/><b>References</b><br/><br/><span id='DLM1'>[1]</span> I.

            description: "In 1983 Louis Kauffman introduced the family of alternative links, as a generalization of alternating links. It is known that alternative links are pseudoalternating. Kauffman conjectured the converse. In this talk we show that both families are equal in the particular case of knots of genus one. However, Kauffman's Conjecture does not hold in general, as we also show by finding two counterexamples. In the way we will deal with the intermediate family of homogeneous links, introduced by Peter Cromwell; the techniques used here allow us to give an explicit characterization of homogeneous links of genus 1.",

This was done by means of the Montesinos trick, that is, by using sums of tangles and double branched covers. Now we give an explicit construction of a subfamily of these knots, so that we can see how the knots look in the 3-sphere. To do that, first we show an embedded handlebody $H$ in the 3-sphere, which is knotted, and such that there is a Möbius band $\\mathcal{M}$ properly embedded in its exterior, and such that the boundary of  $\\mathcal{M}$ intersects any meridian disk of $H$. The core of  $\\mathcal{M}$ is then the knot with the required Dehn surgery.",

However, the following are still unknown:<br/>(1) Given a hyperbolic 3-manifold, does it admit a geometric triangulation, i.e. a decomposition into ideal tetrahedra that are positively oriented and convex with respect to the given hyperbolic metric?<br/>(2) When is a triangulation minimal, i.e. uses the least number of tetrahedra required by its topology?<br/>In combinatorics and computational topology, there are additional questions along the lines of:<br/>(3) How bad can a triangulation be?<br/><br/>In this talk, I will discuss recent results on (3).

The space of all such subalgebras of a given codimension $d$ is a semialgebraic variety.<br/><br/>We will consider these varieties, their natural compactifications, and the canonical $d$-dimensional normal bundles on them. Lower bounds on the dimensions of non-trivial characteristic classes of these bundles will be given, and their implications in knot theory and interpolation theory will be discussed.",

            description: "There are two perspectives we often get on a ribbon disk for a knot $K$ in the $3$-sphere:<br/<br/>A ribbon disk is defined as either an immersed disk in $S^3$ with only ribbon self-intersections, or an embedded disk in $B^4$ with no maxima with respect to the radial Morse function.  These definitions are often called \"equivalent\", but more technically, the difference between them is like the difference between a knot and a knot diagram; one is an embedding, and the other is a lower-dimensional projection of an embedding.  The \"ribbon number\" $r(K)$ for a ribbon knot $K$ is the smallest number of ribbon intersections among any projection of any ribbon disk bounded by $K$, and $r(K)$ can then be seen as a sort of crossing number for ribbon disks.  The Alexander polynomial of $K$ can be used with rather surprising accuracy to give lower bounds for $r(K)$, and we discuss our work in understanding and cataloguing ribbon numbers for low-crossing ribbon knots.<br/><br/>Parts of this talk are joint with Stefan Friedl, Jeffrey Meier, Filip Misev, Evan Scott, and many undergraduate students.",

This space is a complex, quasi-projective variety of dimension $3g-3$, and geometrically an orbifold under the action of the modular group. The set of singular points, the <i>branch locus</i>, may be stratified into a finite, disjoint union of smooth, irreducible, quasi-projective subvarieties called <i>equisymmetric strata</i>. Each stratum corresponds to a collection of surfaces of the same <i>symmetry type</i>, i.e. the conjugacy class of a finite group in the modular group.<br/><br/>The (complex) 1D strata are Riemann surfaces with punctures. We study these strata as punctured Riemann surfaces, in terms of the action of the automorphism group of the surfaces in the stratum. In this way the strata can be constructed, a la Hurwitz, as (branched) coverings of the Riemann sphere with four punctures or a torus with one puncture. We see that such strata are in fact Belyi curves. It will be interesting to see which ones are given by regular dessins d'enfants.",

            description: "Fluid turbulence is a phenomenon characterised by the production of complex, large-scale tangles of vortex filaments that before final dissipation tend to decay to small-scale loops. A topological analysis of superfluid tangles shows that very complex knots and links are formed, and that upon mutual interaction and reconnection they gradually decompose to form small, unknotted, unlinked vortex rings [<a href='program#KKI16'>1</a>,<a href='program#CMBB19'>2</a>]. By using standard polynomials of knot theory derived from the fieldline helicity of vortex dynamics [<a href='program#RL23'>3</a>] we showed that our adapted polynomials can <i>quantify</i> the generic topological cascade observed in experiments [<a href='program#LRG24'>4</a>]. Here we present a topological approach to turbulence cascade based on the idea that the dynamical process could be viewed in terms of geodesic flows in an appropriate knot polynomial space (a discrete metric space), whose singletons represent knot types identified by their knot polynomial value [<a href='program#LRL20'>5</a>]. Optimal unlinking paths can thus be determined and put in relation with statistical measures of energy dissipation and information entropy. Work in this direction is in progress.<br/><br/>This is joint work with Xin Liu (Beijing University of Technology, P.R.

The calculation depends on Deloup’s Reciprocity Theorem which allows us to express the invariant in terms of the linking form of the manifold.

His construction of the bracket polynomial, and more strikingly of the Dubrovnik version of his 2-variable polynomial from the Brandt-Lickorish-Millett-Ho polynomial, made a key use of framing. At the same time he showed how framing works well with the Homfly polynomial, using a memorable set of skein relations.<br/><br/>Framing plays an essential role in constructing satellite knots and related invariants. It is also central in the behaviour of quantum group based invariants, and guides the best ways to compare diverse appearances of invariants.<br/><br/>I will recall Rudolph's early work relating Dubrovnik to the Homfly of a reverse parallel, pointing out the clean comparison when framing is kept in mind, and also the more general relation between coloured Dubrovnik and suitably coloured Homfly invariants.",

Ribbon surface-links are identified with chord graphs, and are a relaxed version of virtual graphs including virtual knotoids with groups identified with the fundamental groups. If a stabilization of a surface-link is a ribbon surface-link, then any handle-irreducible summand of the stabilized surface-link is a ribbon surface-link which is determined uniquely from the surface-link up to equivalences and stabilizations. Many results are obtained by using this result together with several other results. A surface-link with free fundamental group is a stabilization of a ribbon sphere-link, and a trivial surface-link if the fundamental group is  meridian-based. A connected sum of surface-links is a ribbon surface-link if and only if both the connected summands are ribbon surface-links. A surface-link of trivial components is a ribbon surface-link if the components are sphere-components except for at most one component. It will be also explained how this argument is related to 4D and 3D Poincare conjectures, J. H. C.

After that, by using some geometrical consideration, one can \"automatically\" prove that such transformation lead to a solution of some equation (for example, the Ptolemy transormation givves a solution to the pentagon equation) which leads to invariants of various objects (for example, braids). After that, one can \"freely\" (without any calculations) get a formula coming from some geometrical data (say, lengths in the hyperbolic space). Having such a formula, one automatically gets its algebraic proof which allows one to pass from geometric objects (lengths, angles) to variables. This method is very vaste. In particular, Dijkgraaf-Witten invariants can be interpreted in terms of the photography method. We mention just some relations of further research: invariants of knots, braids, manifolds of arbitrary dimensions, solutions to the pentagon, Yang-Baxter and other equations, relations to cluster algebras, tropical geometry and other parts of mathematics.",

In particular, I show how to prove the smallest nontrivial example, the Birkhoff diamond (four adjacent pentagons), is reducible using our filtered $3$- and $4$-color homology. In this context reducible means that the Birkhoff diamond cannot show up as a \"tangle\" in a minimal counterexample to the four color theorem. This is a new proof of a 111-year-old result that is a direct consequence of a special $(2+1)$-dimensional topological quantum field theory.

Using tangles Conway managed to tabulate all knots up to $11$ crossings, and links up to $10$ crossings. Moreover, he found a bijection relation between rational numbers and a subclass of tangles called \"rational tangles\", thus fully classifying this subset of algebraic tangles.<br/><br/>Over 50 years later we extended Conway work. We introduced a binary tree notation, which helped us to define a unique \"canonical representation\" for algebraic tangles. This let us classify algebraic tangles up to $14$ crossings. Moreover we studied symmetry groups of algebraic tangles.<br/><br/>During the talk I'll introduce you to the theory of tangles and present our results.<br/><br/>It is a joint work with Boštjan Gabrovšek and Joanna Sułkowska.",

Line defects are one-dimensional phase singularities (forming oriented knots and links) that arise in a variety of physical systems (fluid dynamics, magnetic fields, excitable media). In these systems, isophase surfaces (Seifert surfaces) have the phase defects as boundary, and these Seifert surfaces define a framing of the normal bundle of each link component. We define the individual helicity for each component of a link singularity, and prove that each individual helicity is zero if and only if there exists a Seifert framing for the link. We extend these results to multi-armed defects. We prove that under anti-parallel reconnection of framed defect strands that both twist and writhe helicity are conserved.<br/><br/><b>References<br/><br/></b>C. E. Laing, Renzo L. Ricca, D.W.

They can be also represented by graph diagrams by taking the spine of ribbons. Their moves for isotopy are known in terms of graph moves. A group heap is a group with the ternary self-distributive operation defined by $(x,y,z) \\mapsto xy^{-1}z$. We show that the fundamental heap is defined for surface ribbons by group presentations from their graph diagrams. Further, the Hopf algebra version of heaps are used to construct braided Frobenius algebras, that are associative algebras with the Yang-Baxter operators (YBO), such that multiplications and YBO satisfy compatibility conditions that correspond to graph moves. For such algebras with YBO, Yang-Baxter Hochschild cohomology is defined from deformations, unifying the two theories.

In particular, is the Bing sling isotopic to a PL knot? <br/><span id='Melikhov_B'>(B)</span> If two PL links in $S^3$ are isotopic, are they PL isotopic? <br/><br/>According to R. Daverman, Problem <a href='program#Melikhov_A'>(A)</a> goes back to the mid-60s, while M. Freedman \"strongly suspects\" that it was discussed in the mid-50s. Problem <a href='program#Melikhov_B'>(B)</a> is implicit in J. Milnor's 1957 paper, where he studied in detail some conditions on isotopies which hold trivially for PL isotopies.<br/><br/>We show that the answer to <a href='program#Melikhov_B'>(B)</a> is positive if finite type invariants separate PL links in $S^3$. In fact, we show that finite type invariants separate PL links in $S^3$ if and only if the answer to <a href='program#Melikhov_B'>(B)</a> is positive and certain 5 other (rather diverse) conjectures hold simultaneously [arXiv:2406.09331].<br/><br/>Regarding <a href='program#Melikhov_A'>(A)</a>, it was previously shown by the author that not every link in $S^3$ is isotopic to a PL link [arXiv:2011.01409]. Now we show that the Bing sling $B$ is not isotopic to any PL knot by an isotopy which extends to an isotopy of any $2$-component link obtained from $B$ by adding a disjoint component $Q$ such that $lk(B,Q)=1$. Moreover, the assertion remains true if the additional component is allowed to self-intersect, and even to get replaced by a new one at any time instant $t$, as long as it remains disjoint from the original component $K_t$ and represents the same conjugacy class as the old one in $G/[G',G'']$, where $G=\\pi_1(S^3\\setminus K_t)$ [arXiv:2406.09365]. <br/><br/>The proofs are based in part on a geometric formula (in terms of iterated intersections of Seifert surfaces) for the formal analogues of Cochran's derived invariants for PL links of linking number $1$. These formal analogues are defined by using the $2$-variable Conway polynomial [arXiv:math/0312007v3].",

            description: "A hyperbolic structure on a three-dimensional cone manifold with a knot as a singular set can usually be deformed into a limit Euclidean structure. In our paper [1] we show that the corresponding normalized Euclidean volume of the manifold is always an algebraic number, i.e., a root of some polynomial with integer coefficients. This result is a generalization (for cone manifolds) of the well-known Sabitov theorem on the volumes of Euclidean polyhedra, which gave an answer to the bellows problem. The fact we established stands out against the background of hyperbolic volumes, the number-theoretic nature of which is usually quite complex. In addition to this theorem, we propose an algorithm that allows one to explicitly calculate the minimal polynomial for a normalized Euclidean volume.<br/><br/><b>Example</b><br/><br/>Cone manifold over a knot $5_2$ has a normalized Euclidean volume $$1/\\left(6\\sqrt{-6+68\\sqrt{2}+4\\sqrt{983+946\\sqrt{2}}} \\right)=0.009909630999945638\\ldots$$ Its minimal polynomial is $$1+864\\,x^2-64457856\\,x^4-412091172864\\,x^6-785065068490752\\,x^8.$$ The talk is based on our joint work [1] with Alexander Kolpakov and Alexander Mednykh.<br/><br/><b/>References</b><br/><br/>[1] N.

            description: "For a low-dimensional manifold, one often tries to understand its intrinsic topology through its submanifolds, in particular of codimension 1. For a $3$-manifold, embedded essential surfaces give information about that manifold. However to construct, classify or count such surfaces is a non-trivial task. Since the 1980s, it has been known that essential surfaces in alternating link complements in $3$-sphere can be isotoped to be \"almost\" transverse to the link diagram, and described combinatorially as a result. This was called standard position for surfaces, due to Menasco and Menasco-Thistlethwaite for various types of surfaces, and has had numerous applications. With Jessica Purcell, we extended standard position for surfaces to a broad class of cusped $3$-manifolds. The manifolds include links that are alternating on higher genus surfaces, and lie in manifolds besides the $3$-sphere, e.g. many virtual links and toroidally alternating links. Applications of these techniques include polynomial upper bound on the number of surfaces embedded in such $3$-manifolds and their Dehn fillings. The bound is universal: there is explicit formula that depends on three known parameters, which describe topology of the surface and $3$-manifold. Another related new result goes beyond links: a universal upper bound for the number of surfaces embedded in any hyperbolic $3$-manifold, closed or cusped, polynomial in hyperbolic volume. For this, different techniques had to be developed, blending minimal and normal surface theory.<br/><br/>The latter is joint work with Marc Lackenby.",

Alegria.<br/><br/>From classical knot theory we know that every knot in $S^3$ is the boundary of an oriented, embedded surface.  A standard demonstration of this fact achieved by elementary technique comes from taking a regular projection of any knot and employing Seifert's constructive algorithm.  In this note we give a natural generalization of Seifert's algorithm to any closed integral homology $3$-sphere.  The starting point of our algorithm is presenting the handle structure of a Heegaard splitting of a given integral homology sphere as a planar diagram on the boundary of a $3$-ball. (For a well known example of such a planar presentation, see the Poincaré homology sphere planar presentation in <i>Knots and Links</i> by Dale Rolfsen).  An oriented link can then be represented by the regular projection of an oriented $k$-strand tangle.  From there we give a natural way to find a \"Seifert circle\" and associated half-twisted bands.",

The universal invariant labels, which carry the most information, can be thought of as equivalence classes of arcs and crossings modulo the relation, which identifies corresponding elements of diagrams connected by a Reidemeister move. One can call these equivalence classes the arcs and crossings of the knot. In the talk we give a topological description of sets of these classes.",

In this talk, we first observe that the classical result of Edmonds, concerning the existence of an invariant <i>minimal genus</i> Seifert surface for <i>periodic knots</i>, does not hold for strongly invertible knots. However, as independently observed by Hiura and Boyle-Issa, every strongly invertible knot admits an invariant Seifert surface.<br/><br/>Note that if $S$ is an invariant Seifert surface for $(K,h)$, then $\\delta:=S\\cap \\operatorname{Fix}(h)$ is one of the two subarcs of $\\operatorname{Fix}(h)\\cong S^1$ bounded by $K\\cap \\operatorname{Fix}(h)\\cong S^0$. We call the triple $(K,h,\\delta)$  a <i>labeled strongly invertible knot</i> and define its {\\it equivariant genus} $g(K,h,\\delta)$ as the minimal genus of invariant Seifert surfaces for $(K,h,\\delta)$.<br/><br/>Our main result is the determination of the equivariant genera of all labeled strongly invertible knots whose underlying knots are $2$-bridge knots. This result, in particular, implies that for any pair of positive integers $(g,\\hat g)$ with $g\\le \\hat g$, there is a marked strongly invertible knot $(K,h,\\delta)$ such that $(g(K), g(K,h,\\delta))=(g,\\hat g)$.

The latter gives rise to a knotoid (or linkoid) spectrum of a knot, which determines the knot type not only via its knot-type knotoids, but also its pure knotoids. For example, we will prove that the pure knotoids in the knotoid spectra of a knot, which are individually agnostic of the knot type, can distinguish knots of Gordian distance greater than one. We will also prove that the neighborhood of, at least, some embeddings of the unknot can be distinguished from any embedding of any non-trivial knot that satisfies the cosmetic crossing conjecture.<br/><br/>Topological invariants of knots can be extended to their open curve neighborhood to define continuous functions in the neighborhood of knots. We will discuss their properties and prove that invariants in the neighborhood of knots may be able to distinguish more knots than their application to the knots themselves. For example, we will prove that an invariant of knots that fails to distinguish mutant knots (and mutant knotoids), can distinguish them by their neighborhoods, unless it also fails to distinguish non-mutant pure knotoids in their spectra. Studying the neighborhood of knots opens the possibility of answering questions, such as if an invariant can detect the unknot, via examining possibly easier questions, such as whether it can distinguish height one knotoids from the trivial knotoid.",

This includes knotoids and linkoids and certain cases of knots and links in thickened surfaces.

            description: "The Kauffman bracket skein module (KBSM) generalizes the Jones polynomial to arbitrary $3$-manifolds, offering insights into their geometric and topological properties. In this talk, in honor of Louis Kauffman’s 80th birthday, we develop a braid-theoretic framework for computing the KBSM of $3$-manifolds and focus on its structure for lens spaces, including $S^1\\times S^2$. Our approach utilizes the generalized Temperley-Lieb algebra of type B, that we also introduce. Time permitting, we will also present the Kauffman bracket polynomial for pseudo knots in the solid torus and handlebodies, as well as for knotoids in the solid torus, highlighting new results inspired by Kauffman’s pioneering work.",

            description: "In $\\mathbb R^3$ every knot can be embedded in the union of finitely many halfplanes having a common boundary line such that each halfplane contains a properly embedded single arc of the knot. Such an embedding is called an <i>arc presentation</i>. The minimal number of halfplanes required for an arc presentation of  a knot is called the <i>arc index</i> of the knot. Every knot has a diagram which is a non-simple rectilinear polygon such that vertical edges  cross over horizontal edges at all crossings. It is called a <i>grid diagram</i>. It is easily seen that an arc presentation gives rise to a grid diagram and vice versa. In this talk, we explain how minimal grid diagrams of the prime knots with $14$ cossings are obtained and thus their arc index is determined.<br/><br/><img src='/assets/Gyo_Taek_Jin.png'/><br/>This is a joint work with many others to be named during the talk.",

I was, then, working  on incompressible surfaces (with Maite Lozano) and I just discovered  the (conjectural) smallest volume hyperbolic 3-manifold. I talked about these topics in Zaragoza. However,  Josè also showed me notes by Lou Kauffman, who visited Zaragoza before me. The notes were the base of the future book \"On Knots\".<br/><br/>What caught my attention was reference to the work by physicists Ball and Metha on an inductive proof of the existence of the Alexander polynomial. Lou incorporated in the notes an outline of the proof. Few months later we were able to prove (with Paweł Traczyk in November-December 1984) the existence of the generalized Jones (HOMFLYPT) link polynomial invariant. Almost 30 years later (in 2012) I was able to define/construct the homology of a general Yang-Baxter operator (in friendly competition with Victoria Lebed). I am now computing with my students and grand-students homology of the HOMFLYPT Yang-Baxter operator. In my talk I describe my winding path from 1984 till 2025, from Lou Kauffman hint to Yang-Baxter homology.",

An oriented classical link can be regarded as a colored link with its components colored with a sole color. In this talk, we provide a state-sum construction for an invariant $F(L)$ of colored links $L$, via a graphical calculus for oriented, colored, $4$-valent planar graphs. When the components of the colored link $L$ are colored with the same color or when the colored link is a knot, $F(L)$ is a specialization of the HOMFLY-PT polynomial of classical links. Francesca Aicardi has shown that $F(L)$ is a stronger invariant than the HOMFLY-PT polynomial when evaluated on colored links whose components have different colors.<br/><br/>This is joint work with Audrey Baumheckel and Conor Righetti and was inspired by the paper \"Link Polynomials and a Graphical Calculus\" by Lou Kauffman and Pierre Vogel.
