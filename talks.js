What is more surprising, though, is that solving such long-standing open problems also contributes to an entirely different field: the development of the next generation AI systems. We live in an exciting time where mathematics and AI can greatly benefit each other, and the goal of the talk is to explain how and why, drawing on specific examples from topology and knot theory.",

The original motivation for this construction was a two virtual construction of the speaker that generalizes the Penrose coloring evaluation of planar trivalent graphs to arbitrary trivalent graphs. The talk will begin with these motivations, dwell on colorings and how they are related to knot and link diagrams. Then the talk will discuss generalized bracket polyomials, arrow polynomials, generalized quandles and other invariants for multiple virtuals.",

In this talk I will survey some recent extensions of the invariant to knots in other three-manifolds: in connected sums of $S^1 \\times S^2$ (joint work with Marengon, Sarkar, and Willis), in $RP^3$ (joint work with Willis, and also separate work of Chen), and in a general setting (work by Morrison, Walker and Wedrich; and independently by Ren-Willis). I will describe how these invariants give bounds on the genus of smooth surfaces in $4$-manifolds, and can even detect exotic $4$-manifolds with boundary.",
