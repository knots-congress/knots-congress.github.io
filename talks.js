We live in an exciting time where mathematics and AI can greatly benefit each other, and the goal of the talk is to explain how and why, drawing on specific examples from topology and knot theory.",

The space of all such subalgebras of a given codimension $d$ is a semialgebraic variety.<br/><br/>We will consider these varieties, their natural compactifications, and the canonical $d$-dimensional normal bundles on them. Lower bounds on the dimensions of non-trivial characteristic classes of these bundles will be given, and their implications in knot theory and interpolation theory will be discussed.",

          description: "An overview of ribbon surface-links that have been studied by the speaker to date will be presented. Ribbon surface-links are identified with chord graphs, and are a relaxed version of virtual graphs including virtual knotoids with groups identified with the fundamental groups. If a stabilization of a surface-link is a ribbon surface-link, then any handle-irreducible summand of the stabilized surface-link is a ribbon surface-link which is determined uniquely from the surface-link up to equivalences and stabilizations. Many results are obtained by using this result together with several other results. A surface-link with free fundamental group is a stabilization of a ribbon sphere-link, and a trivial surface-link if the fundamental group is  meridian-based. A connected sum of surface-links is a ribbon surface-link if and only if both the connected summands are ribbon surface-links. A surface-link of trivial components is a ribbon surface-link if the components are sphere-components except for at most one component. It will be also explained how this argument is related to 4D and 3D Poincare conjectures, J. H. C. Whitehead aspherical conjecture, Kervaire conjecture on group weight and the slice-ribbon problem as time allows.",

The original motivation for this construction was a two virtual construction of the speaker that generalizes the Penrose coloring evaluation of planar trivalent graphs to arbitrary trivalent graphs. The talk will begin with these motivations, dwell on colorings and how they are related to knot and link diagrams. Then the talk will discuss generalized bracket polyomials, arrow polynomials, generalized quandles and other invariants for multiple virtuals.",

In this talk I will survey some recent extensions of the invariant to knots in other three-manifolds: in connected sums of $S^1 \\times S^2$ (joint work with Marengon, Sarkar, and Willis), in $RP^3$ (joint work with Willis, and also separate work of Chen), and in a general setting (work by Morrison, Walker and Wedrich; and independently by Ren-Willis). I will describe how these invariants give bounds on the genus of smooth surfaces in $4$-manifolds, and can even detect exotic $4$-manifolds with boundary.",
